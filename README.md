# Strands Agent Builder

> When terminal meets intelligence: AI at your fingertips.

An example Strands agent demonstrating streaming, tool use, and interactivity from your terminal. This agent builder can help you to build your own agents and tools.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pipx install strands-agents-builder

# Run interactive mode
strands

# One-off query
strands "What's the capital of France?"

# Pipe content
cat document.txt | strands "Summarize this"

# Use with knowledge base
strands --kb YOUR_KB_ID "Tell me about our project"
```

## Features

- üí¨ Interactive command-line interface with rich output
- üîç One-off queries via arguments or pipes
- üõ†Ô∏è Powerful integrated tools (12+ tools including shell, editor, HTTP, Python)
- üß† Knowledge base integration for memory and context
- üéÆ Customizable system prompt
- ü™Ñ Nested agent capabilities with tool delegation
- üîß Dynamic tool loading for extending functionality
- üñ•Ô∏è Environment variable management and customization

## Integrated Tools

Strands comes with a comprehensive set of built-in tools:

- **shell**: Run command-line operations with interactive support
- **editor**: View and edit files with syntax highlighting
- **http_request**: Make API calls with authentication support
- **python_repl**: Execute Python code interactively
- **calculator**: Perform mathematical operations powered by SymPy
- **retrieve**: Query knowledge bases for relevant information
- **store_in_kb**: Save content to knowledge bases for future reference
- **load_tool**: Dynamically load additional tools at runtime
- **environment**: Manage environment variables
- **strands**: Create nested agent instances with specialized capabilities
- **dialog**: Create interactive dialog interfaces
- **use_aws**: Make AWS API calls through boto3

## Knowledge Base Integration

Strands can leverage Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to retrieve information and remember conversations.

```bash
# Specify knowledge base via command line
strands --kb YOUR_KB_ID "What does our API do?"

# Or set a default knowledge base via environment variable
export STRANDS_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID="YOUR_KB_ID"
strands "What were our key decisions last week?"
```

Features:
- üîÑ Automatic retrieval of relevant information before answering queries
- üíæ Conversation storage for building persistent memory
- üìù Every exchange is stored with proper formatting for future reference
- üîç Contextual awareness across multiple conversations

## Nested Agent Capabilities

Use the `strands` tool to create specialized sub-agents with their own tools and system prompts:

```python
# Basic usage
agent.tool.strand(query="List files in the current directory")

# With specific tools
agent.tool.strand(
    query="Analyze this Python code",
    tool_names=["python_repl", "editor"],
    system_prompt="You are an expert Python developer specializing in code optimization."
)
```

## Model Configuration

### Optimized Defaults

Strands comes with optimized, maxed-out configuration settings for the Bedrock model provider:

```json
{
    "model_id": "us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0",
    "max_tokens": 64000,
    "boto_client_config": {
        "read_timeout": 900,
        "connect_timeout": 900,
        "retries": {
            "max_attempts": 3,
            "mode": "adaptive"
        }
    },
    "additional_request_fields": {
        "thinking": {
            "type": "enabled",
            "budget_tokens": 2048
        }
    }
}
```

These settings provide:
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (latest high-performance model)
- Maximum token output (64,000 tokens)
- Extended timeouts (15 minutes) for complex operations
- Automatic retries with adaptive backoff
- Enabled thinking capability with 2,048 token budget for recursive reasoning

You can customize these values using environment variables:

```bash
# Maximum tokens for responses
export STRANDS_MAX_TOKENS=32000

# Budget for agent thinking/reasoning
export STRANDS_BUDGET_TOKENS=1024
```

## Custom Model Provider

You can configure strands to use a different model provider with specific settings by passing in the following arguments:

```bash
strands --model-provider <NAME> --model-config <JSON|FILE>
```

As an example, if you wanted to use the packaged Ollama provider with a specific model id, you would run:

```bash
strands --model-provider ollama --model-config '{"model_id": <ID>}'
```

Strands is packaged with the following providers:
| Name | Config |
| ---- | ------ |
| `bedrock` | [reference](<LINK>) |
| `ollama` | [reference](<LINK>) |

If you have implemented a custom model provider ([instructions](<LINK>)) and would like to use it with strands, create a python module under the directory "$CWD/.models" and expose an `instance` function that returns an instance of your provider. As an example, assume you have:

```bash
$ cat ./.models/custom_model.py
from mymodels import CustomModel

def instance(**config):
    return CustomModel(**config)
```

You can then use it with strands by running:

```bash
$ strands --model-provider custom_model --model-config <JSON|FILE>
```

## Custom Systm Prompts

```bash
# Via environment variable
export STRANDS_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are a Python expert."

# Or local file
echo "You are a security expert." > .prompt
```

## Contributing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strands-agents/agent-builder.git ~/.agent-builder
cd ~/.agent-builder
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install -e ".[test]"

# Run tests
hatch run test         # Run all tests with verbose coverage output
hatch run test -k test_pattern  # Run specific tests matching a pattern
```

Testing is managed through hatch scripting in pyproject.toml.
